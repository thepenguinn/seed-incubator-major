\noindent This week, CAD design of top hatch, assembling of both the side panels of
electronics bay, and redesign of electronics bay connectors had been done.

\subsection{CAD Design of Top Hatch Frame}

See figures \ref{fig:topHatchAlone} and \ref{fig:topHatchAttached} for the
designed frame.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabularx} {\textwidth} {
            >{\centering \arraybackslash}m{0.49\textwidth}
            >{\centering \arraybackslash}m{0.49\textwidth}
        }

        \includegraphics [
            width = 0.48\textwidth,
            % angle = -90,
        ] {pics/top_hatch_alone.png}
        &
        \includegraphics [
            width = 0.48\textwidth,
            % angle = -90,
        ] {pics/top_hatch_attached.png}

        \\

        &
        \captionof{figure} {Top hatch frame attached to the incubator area.}
        \label{fig:topHatchAttached}

        \\

    \end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Electronics Bay Side Panels}

Both the side panels of electronics bay had been built. See figure \ref{fig:asmElecBay}
for the assembled side panels attached to the electronics bay base.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics [
        width = 0.48\textwidth,
        angle = -90,
    ] {pics/elec_bay.jpg}
    \captionof{figure} {Electronics bay attached together.}
    \label{fig:asmElecBay}
\end{center}

\subsection{Electronics Bay Connectors}

Electronics bay is a area that houses all the electronics parts. So it needs to
withstand constant attaching and detaching to and from the incubator area frame.
In the old design, the side panels are not connected to each others, this can
cause the frame to be weak if not attached to the incubator area frame. Now that
has been redesigned to be a stable frame even when detached from the main frame.
See figures \ref{fig:oldElecBay} and \ref{fig:newElecBay} for the old and new
designs.

        }

        \includegraphics [
            width = 0.48\textwidth,
        ] {pics/elec_bay_old.png}
        &
        \includegraphics [
            width = 0.48\textwidth,
        ] {pics/elec_bay_new.png}
