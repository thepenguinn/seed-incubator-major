\noindent This week, CAD design of top hatch had been completed. Along with
that, electronics bay connectors had been redesigned. Reservoir frame's back
panel, and both the side panels of electronics had been assembled.

\subsection{CAD Design of Top Hatch Frame}

See figures \ref{fig:topHatchAlone} and \ref{fig:topHatchAttached} for the
designed frame.

            >{\centering \arraybackslash}m{0.49\textwidth}
        }

        \includegraphics [
            width = 0.48\textwidth,
            % angle = -90,

        \label{fig:topHatchAttached}

        \\

    \end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Electronics Bay Side Panels}

Both the side panels of electronics bay had been built. See figure \ref{fig:asmElecBay}
for the assembled side panels attached to the electronics bay base.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics [
        width = 0.48\textwidth,
        angle = -90,
    ] {pics/elec_bay.jpg}
    \captionof{figure} {Electronics bay attached together.}
    \label{fig:asmElecBay}
\end{center}

\subsection{Electronics Bay Connectors}

Electronics bay houses all the electronics parts. So it needs to withstand constant
attaching and detaching to and from the incubator area frame, while debugging.
In the old design, the side panels are not connected to each other, this can
cause the frame to be weak if not attached to the incubator area frame. Now that
has been redesigned to be a stable frame even when detached from the main frame.
See figures \ref{fig:oldElecBay} and \ref{fig:newElecBay} for the old and new
designs.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabularx} {\textwidth} {
            >{\centering \arraybackslash}m{0.49\textwidth}
            >{\centering \arraybackslash}m{0.49\textwidth}
        }

        \includegraphics [
            width = 0.48\textwidth,
        ] {pics/elec_bay_old.png}
        &
        \includegraphics [
            width = 0.48\textwidth,
        ] {pics/elec_bay_new.png}

        \\

        &
        \captionof{figure} {New electronics bay design.}
        \label{fig:newElecBay}

        \\

    \end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Reservoir Frame's Back Panel}

Back panel of the reservoir had been built. See figure \ref{fig:asmResBack}
for the assembled back panel.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics [
        width = 0.48\textwidth,
        angle = -90,
    ] {pics/res_back_panel.jpg}
