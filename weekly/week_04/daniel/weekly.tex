\noindent This week the frame of the incubator area had been built and the
circuit diagram for the 32 bit multiplexer had been drawn.

\subsection{Frame for Incubator Area}

These includes front panel, back panel, front side panels, back side panel and
back side hatch. See figure \ref{fig:partsOfIncArea} for the different assembled parts.
Figure \ref{fig:partsOfIncAreaCAD} depicts all the parts that are currently built.

\subsection{Circuit Diagram of 32 Bit Multiplexer}

The proper circuit diagram for the 32-bit multiplexer, which had been pending
since the mini-project, was drawn this week. See figure \ref{fig:32BitMux} for
the completed circuit diagram.

% A proper circuit diagram for the 32 bit multiplexer developed as part of miniproject wasn't done yet.
% That had been taken care of in this week.
