    \textbf{Weekly Report: Growth Monitoring Unit (GMU)}
\end{center}

This week’s focus was on repository management and environment setup. The GMU GitHub repository is now fully operational with proper structure and connectivity. The TinyML folder was created for future model development, and MiKTeX has been configured to support LaTeX documentation for project reports.
