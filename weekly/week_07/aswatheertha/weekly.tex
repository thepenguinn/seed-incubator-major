\noindent This week’s work was focused on developing and wiring the circuit for the automated rail motion system. The schematic reached around 75\% completion and includes the major functional blocks required for reliable stepper motor control and camera-based plant imaging.

\subsection{Rail System Circuit Design Progress}
\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Overview of Circuit Architecture:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The circuit consists of three core modules:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{ESP32 CAM}: For camera imaging, WiFi and processing.
            \item \textbf{ATmega328P}: Dedicated controller for precise stepper movement.
            \item \textbf{DRV8825 Drivers }: Provide current-controlled bipolar stepper motor drive.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Power is distributed using a 12V input supply, regulated to 5V for logic devices.
        \item All grounds are tied together ensuring proper reference for step signals.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Stepper Motor Drive Section:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Two DRV8825 modules are used for X and Y axis motion.
        \item STEP and DIR lines are connected to ATmega328P pins for precise motion pulses.
        \item Motors receive independent power from +12V rail.
        \item 100~$\mu$F capacitors are placed near VMOT for surge protection.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Limit Switch Safety:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item X and Y axis limit switches are connected to digital input pins.
        \item Internal pull-ups ensure noise-free edge detection.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Process of week:}
    \begin{itemize}
       \item ESPCam module was imported from snapade to kicad.
      \item  Lighting connections and necessary resistor connections are being done.
     \item Components list is being prepared.
     \item ESP32 i2c connection to slave mcu and cam has to be established.
    \end{itemize}
