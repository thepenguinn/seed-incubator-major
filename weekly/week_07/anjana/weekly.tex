\subsection{Components List of Linear Rail Mechanism}
A preliminary study of the linear rail mechanism was conducted by referring to various online resources and technical documentation. The specifications of the linear rail, carriage block, motor requirements, and other mechanical parts were reviewed from different sources. Based on this study, an initial set of components required for the linear rail system was identified. However, the complete component list and final specifications are still in progress and will be updated as the design develops further.
