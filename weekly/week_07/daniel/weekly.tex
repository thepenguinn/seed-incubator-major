\noindent This week, side panels of reservoir frame had been built,
redesigned side hatch panels and designed core block mount for the frame.

\subsection{Reservoir Side Panels}

See figure \ref{fig:resSidePanels} for the assembled side panels of the reservoir frame.

        width = 0.6\textwidth,

    \captionof{figure} {Side panels of the reservoir frame.}
    \label{fig:resSidePanels}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Redesign of Side Hatch Panel}

Side hatch panels of the incubators were weak on their own. So, redesigned them to
have more support. See figures, \ref{fig:oldSideHatch} and \ref{fig:newSideHatch}
for the old and new CAD designs respectively.

        \includegraphics [

        \\

    \end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{CAD Design of Core Block Mount}

CAD design for core block mount has been completed. It is designed as two
parts, a base plate and a top covering part. This is to facilitate easy
sliding in and out of the core block. See figure \ref{fig:cbmAlone} for
the CAD design of both the base and top pieces. Figure \ref{fig:cbmAttached}
shows the core block mount attached to the rest of the frame.

            >{\centering \arraybackslash}m{0.49\textwidth}
        }

        \includegraphics [
            width = 0.48\textwidth,
            % angle = -90,
