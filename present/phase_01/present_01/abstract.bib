abstract = {Maize, a vital global food crop, is susceptible to various diseases impacting agricultural yield and quality, necessitating effective monitoring strategies. This study presents a comprehensive approach utilizing advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for efficient maize leaf disease detection and classification. Leveraging datasets from Kaggle, Harvard Dataverse, and Mendeley, the proposed CNN maize disease detection (MDD) system integrates optimization techniques, data augmentation, batch size adjustments, and fine-tuning strategies. Evaluation through data splitting reveals significant correlations among maize leaf classifications and the influence of data augmentation on image quality. Following training, the CNN-MDD model is deployed on a Microcontroller Unit (MCU) simulation, achieving promising optimization parameters: latency of 7.60 ms, RAM size of 726.60 KB, classifier flash size of 344.70 KB, and an accuracy of 94.60 \%. These optimized parameters align well with MCU specifications, highlighting the potential for practical deployment on low-cost edge devices like Arduino Ble 33 Sense. Additionally, this research contributes to the creation of a Ghanaian maize crop pest and disease dataset and the development of an optimal and cost-effective CNN-MDD MCU edge device, aiming to provide local farmers in Ghana and Sub-Saharan Africa with a swift, offline solution for maize disease detection, thus fostering sustainable agricultural practices. We conduct a comparative analysis of Edge Impulse and TensorFlow, two prominent machine-learning platforms for TinyML model development and deployment in various applications, including smart crop disease detection. Utilizing a dataset comprising 12,344 raw images and 7,454 augmented images of healthy and diseased maize leaves, we evaluate the workflow, features, performance, and usability of each platform. Our findings indicate that Edge Impulse holds a slight advantage over TensorFlow in terms of ease of use, reliability, and memory footprint, whereas TensorFlow offers greater flexibility, customization options, and higher accuracy. We conclude that while both platforms are suitable for crop disease detection, a combined approach allows for leveraging TensorFlow's robust training capabilities for complex neural networks alongside the simplicity of Edge Impulse for deploying models on low-powered edge devices. This synergistic approach enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of crop disease detection systems, ultimately benefiting agricultural practices and food security.}
